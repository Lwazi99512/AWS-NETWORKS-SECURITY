VPC Traffic flow and security
# AWS VPC Traffic Control & Security Project


## üåê Project Overview
Designed a secure **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** network with:
- **Public/Private Subnets** with route tables
- **Security Groups** (resource-level firewall)
- **Network ACLs** (subnet-level traffic rules)
- **Internet Gateway** connectivity

**Key Achievement**: Implemented layered security resembling real-world infrastructure (Security Groups as "guards", ACLs as "traffic cops").
